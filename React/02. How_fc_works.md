# functional components actually work on every single state update, they create a new function, they never reuse the previous one, this previous function should be destroyed and garbage collected automatically

```
function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

    return <div>
        <h1>{count}</h1>
        <button onClick={()=>setCount(count + 1)} >increment</button>
    </div>
}
```

when we click increment button this function gets executed and it's going to create another new function it's going to call this function again and this count, setCount receive new values,

this is why we are able to use const within the functional component

```
const [count, setCount]
```
